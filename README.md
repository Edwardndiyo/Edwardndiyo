## About Me
I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on **backend development**, though I'm also a full-stack developer. I have keen interests in building **Telegram bots** and working with cutting-edge technologies. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I'm currently exploring **MAUI** for cross-platform development.

- 💼 **Backend Engineer Intern** at [Deimr](https://www.deimr.com)

- [**Py-Response Paradox**](https://github.com/edwardndiyo/pyresponse-paradox) - A **Python** library that automatically handles response codes and messages. Instead of memorizing what each code means, simply call functions from the library to handle it for you.
